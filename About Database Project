# DataBase
You can create your database  and can perform (CRUD) operation on it  and finally save all databases in different csv files.

In this piece of software (.exe file) you can create a database and once you choose for creation of database, it will ask you about the database name. and then it will ask you 
about the column name for the data types - string, int and float. and once you are done with column name. Then you have another set of choices where you can add items inside the
database and can also perform update and delete operation on this column and content of the database. You can also see the current data present in the database.

You can create multiple database of different types - like hotel, school and others and finally you can save it in files and their name will be the name of the database you 
created.
